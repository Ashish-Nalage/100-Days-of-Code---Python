# Day 5 - PyPassword Generator

## What I Learned
- **Loops:** Used `for` loops to generate password components.
- **Random Choice and Shuffle:** Learned `random.choice()` to randomly select characters and `random.shuffle()` to mix up the password.
- **Building Lists and String Concatenation:** Practiced adding characters to a list and then building the final password by concatenating each item into a single string.

## Project Overview
The PyPassword Generator creates a random password based on user preferences for letters, numbers, and symbols. This project uses loops, lists, and randomization to build a secure password.

## How It Works
- The program asks for the number of letters, symbols, and numbers the user wants in their password.
- It then randomly selects characters from each category and combines them into a password.
- The password characters are shuffled to make it unpredictable and secure.

## Code Highlights
- Loops to generate character lists for the password
- `random.choice()` and `random.shuffle()` for random selection and mixing
- Concatenating items to form the final password string
