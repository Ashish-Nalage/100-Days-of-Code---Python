# Day 6 - Reeborg's Hurdle and Maze Problems

## What I Learned
- **Functions:** Introduced the concept of functions to organize code and perform specific tasks also how to create own functions.
- **While Loops:** Learned how to use `while` loops for repeated actions until a condition is met.
- **Code Blocks:** Reinforced the importance of organizing code using indentation and blocks.
- **Conditional Statements:** Applied conditions to navigate through hurdles and mazes.
- **Problem-Solving:** Enhanced problem-solving skills through algorithmic thinking.


## Project Overview
Today, I worked on Reeborg's challenges: Hurdle1, Hurdle2, Hurdle3, Hurdle4, and Maze, which involve guiding a robot through various obstacles and paths. For more information about the challenges, you can search for Reeborg's World on Google.

## How It Works
- The robot must be programmed to move through a series of hurdles and navigate mazes by making decisions based on its environment.
- The challenges improve logic skills by requiring step-by-step reasoning.

## Code Highlights
- Implementing loops and conditionals to control the robot's movements
- Making functions and using builtin function on the website for creating logic 
- Testing and refining code to successfully complete challenges
