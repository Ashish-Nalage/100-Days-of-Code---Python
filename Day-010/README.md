# Day 10 - Calculator

## What I Learned
- **Functions with Output:** Explored how to create functions that return values instead of just printing them.
- **Return vs. Print:** Understood the difference between using `return` to send a value back from a function and `print` to display output directly.
- **Multiple Returns:** Learned how to use conditional statements within functions to return different values based on specific conditions.
- **Docstrings:** Discovered the importance of documenting functions with docstrings to describe their purpose and usage.

## Project Overview
In this project, I built a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). The program allows users to input numbers and choose operations, displaying the results in an interactive loop. This project reinforced my understanding of function definitions and the practical application of functions in a real-world scenario.

## How It Works
- The user is prompted to input the first number.
- The program displays a list of operations the user can choose from.
- The user selects an operation and inputs a second number.
- The calculator performs the operation using the appropriate function and displays the result.
- Users can continue calculating with the result or start a new calculation.

## Code Highlights
- Defined functions for each arithmetic operation: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`.
- Created a dictionary to map operation symbols to their corresponding functions for easy access.
- Implemented a loop that allows the user to perform multiple calculations until they decide to exit.
- Used a logo from the `art` library for visual appeal.
