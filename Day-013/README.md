# Day 13 - Debugging

## What I Learned
- **Understanding Code Behavior**: Analyzing what the program is intended to do and how it should function.
- **Identifying Breakpoints**: Finding where the code fails or produces errors by examining the output and logic flow.
- **Reproducing Errors**: Testing specific scenarios to reproduce errors consistently, which helps in pinpointing the root cause.
- **Playing as a Computer**: Manually stepping through the code line by line, simulating what the computer would do.
- **Using Stack Overflow**: Leveraging the programming community for common issues and finding solutions from experienced developers.
- **Using Debugger Tools**: Utilizing Python's built-in debugger (`pdb`) or IDE debuggers to inspect the code in real-time and understand variable states.
- **Running Code Frequently**: Testing the code incrementally while writing to catch errors early.
- **Taking Breaks**: Stepping away from the code to approach the problem with a fresh perspective.

## Additional Debugging Techniques
### Using `print()` Statements for Debugging
- **Quick Checks**: Use print statements to check the values of variables at different stages of the program.
- **Debugging Output**: Add debug-specific messages (e.g., `[DEBUG]`) to identify debugging output easily.

### Using `try-except` for Error Handling
- **Prevent Crashes**: The `try-except` block helps catch errors during execution without stopping the program.
- **Custom Error Messages**: Provide helpful feedback for common issues like `ZeroDivisionError` or `TypeError`.
