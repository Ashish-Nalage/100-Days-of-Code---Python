# Day 16 - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## What I Learned
Today, I delved into the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, including:
- **OOP Fundamentals**: Understanding the purpose and benefits of using OOP to structure code.
- **Classes and Objects**:
  - **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects (a collection of attributes and methods).
  - **Object**: An instance of a class.
- **Attributes and Methods**:
  - **Attributes**: Variables that belong to an object (instance variables).
  - **Methods**: Functions defined inside a class that describe the behaviors of the object.
- **Accessing Attributes and Methods**: Using dot notation to access an object's attributes and call its methods.
