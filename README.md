# 100 Days of Code - Python

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code journey! This repository documents my progress through [Angela Yuâ€™s 100 Days of Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) course on Udemy, where Iâ€™m diving deep into Python programming concepts and applying them in real-world projects. Each day focuses on different topics, building up my skills gradually from beginner to advanced levels.

## About the Course
This course covers Python from the basics all the way to advanced topics, combining coding exercises with interactive projects. By the end of the 100 days, Iâ€™ll have a complete portfolio of projects that show my skills, from games and apps to data analysis and automation tools.

### Course Sections
The course is structured into five main levels, each introducing new topics and gradually increasing in complexity:
- **Beginner:** Days 001-014 - Starting from the fundamentals of Python.
- **Intermediate:** Days 015-031 - Exploring more complex data structures and algorithms.
- **Intermediate+:** Days 032-058 - Working with APIs, web scraping, and data processing.
- **Advanced:** Days 059-081 - Diving into web development, databases, and Flask.
- **Professional:** Days 082-100 - Learning about data science, advanced GUIs, automation, and more.

## Repository Structure
Each day in the course has its own folder in this repository, containing a README and the code for that dayâ€™s project. This structure keeps track of my daily progress and allows me to revisit topics whenever I need a refresher.
