# 100 Days of Code - Python

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code journey! This repository documents my progress through [Angela Yuâ€™s 100 Days of Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) course on Udemy, where Iâ€™m diving deep into Python programming concepts and applying them in real-world projects. Each day focuses on different topics, building up my skills gradually from beginner to advanced levels.

## About the Course
This course covers Python from the basics all the way to advanced topics, combining coding exercises with interactive projects. By the end of the 100 days, Iâ€™ll have a complete portfolio of projects that show my skills, from games and apps to data analysis and automation tools.

### Course Sections
The course is structured into five main levels, each introducing new topics and gradually increasing in complexity:
- **Beginner:** Days 001-014 - Starting from the fundamentals of Python.
- **Intermediate:** Days 015-031 - Exploring more complex data structures and algorithms.
- **Intermediate+:** Days 032-058 - Working with APIs, web scraping, and data processing.
- **Advanced:** Days 059-081 - Diving into web development, databases, and Flask.
- **Professional:** Days 082-100 - Learning about data science, advanced GUIs, automation, and more.

## Repository Structure
Each day in the course has its own folder in this repository, containing a README and the code for that dayâ€™s project. This structure keeps track of my daily progress and allows me to revisit topics whenever I need a refresher.

## Why Iâ€™m Doing This
Iâ€™m 19 years old and just starting my programming journey. This course is an important step in building a solid foundation in Python, learning practical coding skills, and preparing for larger projects in the future. This repository will serve as my portfolio to showcase what Iâ€™ve learned, the projects Iâ€™ve created, and my growth as a programmer.

## Projects
Each day's project highlights the skills and concepts covered in that day's lessons. Here is a quick overview of some types of projects I will be working on:
- **Games** - Building games like Blackjack, Snake, and Pong to practice logic, loops, and conditionals.
- **Apps** - Developing apps like a Password Manager and Flash Card Quiz to apply Python to real-life tasks.
- **Web Development** - Creating websites with Flask and exploring frontend and backend development.
- **Data Science** - Working with Pandas, Matplotlib, and APIs for data analysis and visualization.

## Looking Forward
By the end of this journey, Iâ€™ll have a complete portfolio of 100 Python projects that demonstrate my growth in programming. I hope to use this as a stepping stone into more complex projects and maybe even a career in tech!

Thank you for checking out my 100 Days of Code repository. Iâ€™m excited to keep learning and improving, one day at a time.
